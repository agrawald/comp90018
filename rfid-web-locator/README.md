# [rfid-web-locator](http://weblocatorrfid.azurewebsites.net) 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.\

This web application will be used to provide user a capability to track a particular RFID tag around the globe. Using this application, we can search for a specific RFID tag and map all the known locations on Google Map for analysis and tracking purposes.

## basic idea
The idea is to provide user a facility to monitor the RFID tag activity and the analyze all the sensore data associated with the RFID tag.

## technologies

- React.js
- NPM
- HTML

## future scope
- Connect with Azure database to provide valuable insights using ML or AI.

## development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## build
